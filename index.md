## Why NutriComposer?

### **100% FREE**
Created to help people improve their health. The developer struggled for a while to find a good solution and doesn't want others to face similar issues. No ads, no subscriptions, no hidden costs.

### **Privacy-First AI**
The AI Assistant uses Apple Foundation Framework LLM which runs **100% locally on your device**. NO data is ever sent to external servers. Your conversations, food data, and health information stay completely private.
